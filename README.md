**I worked on making dashboard on store sales data using excel**.
## Data loading:
 I loaded data from a open source website providing datasets.
## Data Cleaning:
 There were few empty columns in Rating Column . So, I replaced them with median rating.
 There were formating issues in columns. I fixed width and height of columns and ensure all text columns are in proper format.
## Data processing:
 I created a age group column for better visulation and analyzing the data .
## Data Visulization:
 I visualize data using different chats. i used KPI Cards, pivot tables and proper color format.

## Insights:
1. The store maintains healthy revenue with moderate discounting (under 15%), meaning sales are not overly dependent on heavy promotions.
2. Older customers (51–70) are the highest-spending customers.
3. Electronic devices are giving high revenue.
4. About 80% customers used card for payment.
5. Discount(%) Did not change much across seasons.
